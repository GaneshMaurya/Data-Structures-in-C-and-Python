/*Given a singly linked list, swap kth node from beginning with kth node from end. 
Swapping of data is not allowed, only pointers should be changed. 
This requirement may be logical in many situations where the linked list data part is huge 
(For example student details line Name, RollNo, Address, ..etc). 
The pointers are always fixed (4 bytes for most of the compilers).*/
